Ques-01: Write a C++ program that takes three integers as input from the user and determines the largest of the three using if-else statements.

Sample Input:- Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 20
Enter the third number: 15

Sample Output :- The largest number is: 20


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a,b,c;
    cout<<"Enter the first number: ";
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Enter the second number: ";
    cin>>b;
    cout<<"Enter the third number: ";
    cin>>c;
    if(a>b && a>c){
        cout<<"The largest number is: "<<a;
    }
    else if(b>a && b>c){
        cout<<"The largest number is: "<<b;
    }
    else{
        cout<<"The largest number is: "<<c;
    }
}






Ques-02: Write a C++ program that takes an integer score (0-100) as input from the user and prints the corresponding grade using if-else-if statements.
Grade Criteria:
A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: 0-59

Sample Input:- Enter the score: 85
