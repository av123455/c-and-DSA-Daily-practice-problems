Ques - 01: Write a C++ program that takes an integer N as input from the user and calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using a for loop.

Sample Input:- Enter a number: 5
Sample Output:- The sum of the first 5 natural numbers is: 15"




#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n,i,sum=0;
    cout<<"Enter a number: ";
    cin>>n;
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++){
        sum+=i;
    }
    cout<<"The sum of the first "<<n<<" natural numbers is: "<<sum<<endl;
}











Ques-03: Write a C++ program that takes an integer N as input from the user and prints the multiplication table of N up to 10 using a loop.

Sample Input:- Enter a number: 3

Sample Output:-
Multiplication table of 3:
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30











Ques-02: Write a C++ program that takes an integer N as input from the user and calculates the factorial of N using a loop.

Sample Input:- Enter a number: 4
Sample Output:- The factorial of 4 is: 24




#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n,i,fact=1;
    cout<<"Enter a number: ";
    cin>>n;
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++){
        fact*=i;
    }
    cout<<"The factorial of "<<n<<" is: "<<fact<<endl;
}
