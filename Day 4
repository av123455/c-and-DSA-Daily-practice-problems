Ques:01: Write a C++ program that takes two integers as input and performs the following arithmetic operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division (ensure that you handle division by zero)
Modulus

Sample Output :-

Enter first integer: 10
Enter second integer: 3
Addition: 13
Subtraction: 7
Multiplication: 30
Division: 3.33333
Modulus: 1




#include <iostream>
#include<cstdlib>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   int x,y;
    double c;
    cout<<"Enter first intger: ";
    cin>>x;
    cout<<"Enter the second integer: ";
    cin>>y;
     c=x/y;
    cout<<"Addition: "<<x+y<<endl;
    cout<<"Subtraction: "<<abs(x-y)<<endl;
    cout<<"Multiplication: "<<x*y<<endl;
    if(y==0){
        cout<<"Division is not possible";
    }
    else{
        cout<<"Division: "<<c<<endl;
    }
    cout<<"Modulus: "<<x%y;
    return 0;
}







Ques-02: Create a Complex class to represent complex numbers and overload the +, -, operators to perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.

Sample Output:-

Complex Number 1: 3 + 4i
Complex Number 2: 1 + 2i
Sum: 4 + 6i
Difference: 2 + 2i
