 Ques-01 Write a C++ program that takes two strings as input from the user and concatenates them. Then, output the concatenated string.
Sample Input :- Enter the first string: Hello
Enter the second string: World
Sample Output:- Concatenated string: HelloWorld


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    string a;
    string b;
 cout<<"Enter the first string: "<<endl;
 cin>>a;
 cout<<"Enter the second string:  "<<endl;
 cin>>b;
 cout<<a+b<<endl;
    return 0;
}





Ques-02 Write a C++ program that takes five grades (integers) as input from the user and calculates the average grade. Output the average grade to the user.

Sample Input:- Enter grade 1: 85
Enter grade 2: 90
Enter grade 3: 78
Enter grade 4: 92
Enter grade 5: 88

Sample Output:- The average grade is: 86.6




#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a,b,c,d,e;
    cout<<"Enter grade 1: ";
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Enter grade 2: ";
    cin>>b;
    cout<<"Enter grade 3: ";
    cin>>c;
    cout<<"Enter grade 4: ";
    cin>>d;
    cout<<"Enter grade 5: ";
    cin>>e;
    cout<<(a+b+c+d+e)*0.2<<endl;
}





Ques- 03 Write a C++ program that takes an integer as input from the user and outputs its square.

Sample Input:- Enter a number: 7

Sample Output :- The square of 7 is: 49



#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a;
    cout<<"Enter a number: ";
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"The square of "<<a<<" is: "<<a*a;
}
